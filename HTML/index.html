        Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR
        Football Club in 1878,<br />changed its name to Manchester United in
        1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.

          <h4>Rebirth</h4>
          <p>
            In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £280,000 in
            2020 – the club was served with a winding-up order. Captain Harry
            Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies
            (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return
            for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently
            changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially
            born.

          <h4>Busby Era (1945-1969)</h4>
          <p>
            Manager Matt Busby led squad of average age 22 famously nicknamed
            The Busby Babes. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first
            league title for 41 years. In 1968, Manchester United became the
            first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in
            the final with a team that contained three European Footballers of
            the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h4>1969-1986</h4>
          <p>
            In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted
            less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in
            December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that
            season, only to see them relegated in 1974. Dave Sexton replaced
            Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977, who was repolaced by Ron
            Atkinson in 1981. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup
            twice in three years – in 1983 and 1985.

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Ferguson Era (1986-2013)</h4>
          <p>
            In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year
            later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive
            title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first "Double" in the
            club's history. United then became the first English club to do the
            Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96,
            before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game
            to spare. In the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first
            team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League –
            "The Treble" – in the same season. By the time Sir Alex Ferguson
            retired, the club had 20 Premier League titles, more than any club
            in history.

          <h4>Premier League</h4>
          <p>
            United have won the English top flight league 20 times. Since 1992,
            Manchester United have won the most competitive league in the world,
            a whopping 13 times.

          <h4>Hattrick Heroes</h4>
          <p>
            Manchester United have the most number of consecutive Premier League
            titles since the inception of the league. They have accomplished
            this feat - a hat-trick of PL titles - not once, but twice.

          <h4>The Treble</h4>
          <p>
            The 1998–99 season was the most successful season in the history of
            Manchester United. United won the treble of trophies (the Premier
            League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League), the first side (and still
            the only) in English football to achieve such a feat.

        <div class="acard">
          <h4>The Academy</h4>
          <p>
            Since 1937, Manchester United have fielded at least one player from
            their Academy in the squad for any match. The streak is now over
            4000 matches! The list of famous names—Duncan Edwards, Bill Foulkes,
            Sir Bobby Charlton, George Best, Ryan Giggs, Garry Neville, David
            Beckham, and Paul Scholes, among many others—speaks for itself.
